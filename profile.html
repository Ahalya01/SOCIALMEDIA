<p><b>Snapchat</b>Snapchat is an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia" target="-blank">multimedia</a> instant messaging app and service developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc." target="-blank">snap inc</a>., originally Snapchat Inc. One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' "Stories" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with "Discover", letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to store photos in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc." target="-blank">password</a>-protected area called "My Eyes Only". It has also reportedly incorporated limited use of end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future.</p>
